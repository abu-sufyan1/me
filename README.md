I am Antonio Stoilkov. I am a developer and entrepreneur working on [a writing app](https://caret.io/) for the last 4.5 years. For the last year and a half we have been working on [a new version](https://twitter.com/careteditor/status/1136198029357264896).

I appreciate people I can learn from. People who **consistently deliver clearly expressed principles** help me the most. This is a niche market as consistency, clarity and principles can commonly be found alone but rarely together. The people below are people I follow, if you know them this will give you a better sense of what I am talking about.
- [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/) â€” I often wonder if his last name "Clear" has something to do with the clarity of his writings.
- [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)
<!-- - Aaron Swartz -->

Making a writing app turned me into a person who writes a lot. This repo contains a few of the things I have written. Below are the principles I try to follow when writing:
- ðŸ’§ **Clarity**
- ðŸ‘¯ **Consistency**
- ðŸ‘Š **Fight the bias**
- ðŸ‘€ **3D View**
