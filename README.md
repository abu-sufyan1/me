I am Antonio Stoilkov. I am a developer and entrepreneur working on [a writing app](https://caret.io/) for the last 4.5 years. For the last year and a half we have been working on [a new version](https://twitter.com/careteditor/status/1136198029357264896).

<br/>

I appreciate people I can learn from. People who **consistently deliver clearly expressed principles** help me the most. This is a niche market as consistency, clarity and principles can commonly be found alone but rarely together. The people below are people I follow. If you know them this will give you a better sense of what I am talking about.

Making a writing app turned me into a person who writes a lot. This repo contains a few of the things I have written. Below are the principles I try to follow when writing:
- ðŸ‘¯ **Consistency** â€” If one article is great but the other is biased, incomplete, one-sided that makes you doubt any future thing you read from me. Consistently delivering good content is important and underrated.
- ðŸ’§ **Clarity** â€” Explaining complex ideas in a simple manner. Not complicating what is already simple.
- ðŸ‘€ **3D view** â€” It's easy to isolate a problem and look it only from your point of view. Being able to consider both advantages and disadvantages from multiple viewpoints is hard mostly because it takes a lot of time because they don't come at once. You have to go back to a single idea multiple times before you complete the whole picture.
