# Answers Don't Stay the Same

Over time answers to the same questions change. Noticing new answers to old but important questions can be an advantage.

Can an electric car be competitive on the market? That answer was "No" for a long time. At some point, the technology for a competitive electric car did become available, but a lot of car companies didn't notice. Tesla as a new car company had to crawl like a baby, grow up in front of everyone's eyes and showcase that indeed the answer has changed.

Smart and experienced people from top car companies weren't able to see what was happening.

This thinking mechanism seems more like an evolutionary advantage rather than a mistake. If we had to constantly go back and question again all our assumptions we wouldn't be able to do much work. Imagine building a house. If every time you asked yourself "Why is this tool the best for the job?" you would probably spend more time thinking instead of building. Retrieving the answer you learned years ago is an optimization we can't live without.

Double-checking everything all the time is impossible. Going back to questions that can make a big impact on your life seems important. Finding the balance can be quite hard but probably worth it.
