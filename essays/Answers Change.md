# Answers Change

Over time answers to the same questions change. Not noticing can be dangerous.

Can an electric car be competitive on the market? That answer was "No" for a long time then the answer changed, but a lot of car companies didn't notice. Tesla as a new car company had to crawl like a baby, grow up in front of everyone's eyes and showcase that indeed the answer has changed. Smart people from top car companies had a blind spot.

Seems like living with a certain belief for a long time makes you perceive it as a certain thing. Most probably the longer you believe in something the harder it is to notice it changed.

This thinking mechanism seems more like an evolutionary advantage rather than a mistake. If we had to constantly go back and question again all our assumptions we wouldn't be able to do much work. Imagine building a house. If you asked yourself "Why is this tool the best for the job?" every time you would probably spend more time thinking rather than building. Retrieving the answer you learned years ago is an optimization we can't live without.

Double checking everything all the time is impossible. Questioning what can make a big impact on your life seems important. Finding the balance can be quite hard but probably worth it.
